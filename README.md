# HM Javascript Library

This is a simple DOM manipulation Javascript library with the goal of being lightweight and modular.  It was created for use on my personal projects where the structure and abstraction of a library was desired, but the page weight of larger JS DOM manipulation libraries was a sore spot.

## What Does HM Stand For?

This is a reference to my personal website [HokieMatt.com](https://hokiematt.com) which is also the moniker I use to identify projects I work on.
