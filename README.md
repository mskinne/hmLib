# HM Javascript Library

This is a simple DOM manipulation Javascript library with the goal of being lightweight and modular.  It was created for use on my personal projects where the structure and abstraction of a library was desired, but the page weight of larger JS DOM manipulation libraries was a sore spot.

## Acknowledgments

The following sites were used to get some ideas for structure for V1 of this project:
* [Build Your First JavaScript Library](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/build-your-first-javascript-library--net-26796)
* [Creating your own JavaScript Library](http://www.mikedoesweb.com/2012/creating-your-own-javascript-library/)

## What Does HM Stand For?

This is a reference to my personal website [HokieMatt.com](https://hokiematt.com) which is also the moniker I use to identify projects I work on.
